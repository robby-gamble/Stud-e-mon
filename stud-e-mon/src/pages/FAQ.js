              That depends on how much time you can give and the type of
              volunteer opportunity that interests you. Evening hosting is just
              a few hours and is perfect for volunteers with busy schedules. For
              those with a bit more time, our ‘done in a day’ projects, like
              gardening at a Day Center and helping at a special event, work
              well. Whereas volunteering to teach financial literacy and
              technology skills is best for volunteers who are capable of a
              longer time commitment.

              Family Promise volunteers can have a lasting impact on a family’s
              life without making a huge time commitment. One-time volunteer
              opportunities – such as helping at a special event or
              participating in a supply drive – exist and work well for those
              with full schedules. There are also plenty of opportunities for
              volunteers who are available to make a more long-term, regular
              commitment.

              Family Promise wants every volunteer to feel comfortable, so we do
              offer training. Volunteers directly working with our families are
              required to go through an orientation. Additional training,
              tailored to the specific volunteer project, will also be provided.

              We offer opportunities for entire families to volunteer. For
              example, families often enjoy volunteering in the evenings when
              they can share a meal with the guest families and children can
              enjoy some play time together.

              There are opportunities for you to volunteer with a group of
              colleagues or even with just a single co-worker. When you are
              matched with an Affiliate, the volunteer coordinator will help you
              identify a project that works best for your team.

              Family Promise offers volunteer opportunities during the day, in
              the evening, and on weekends. Scheduling depends on the type of
              volunteer activity. For example, volunteers providing homework
              help will do so in the evenings or on the weekends. And volunteers
              assisting at our office may do so during regular business hours.
